# Augmented Reality (AR) App for Training and Education

## Overview
This project is an interactive, marker-based Augmented Reality (AR) application built to enhance training and education through immersive 3D visualizations. Using Unity, ARCore, Vuforia, and custom-designed 3D models from Blender, the application projects realistic 3D objects such as the sun, boat, sea, car, house, and airplane when the device camera detects predefined image markers.

The application includes animations, voice-over explanations, and background audio to create an engaging learning experience. It is packaged as a fully functional Android APK that runs smoothly on AR-supported devices.

## Objectives
- Enhance learning through AR-based visualizations.
- Provide an intuitive user interface for students and trainees.
- Demonstrate real-time marker-based 3D model projection.
- Integrate 3D models, audio, and animations for educational use.
- Showcase Unity, ARCore, and Vuforia working together.

---

## Features
- Marker-based AR detection using Vuforia and ARCore.
- Projection of multiple high-quality 3D models:
  - Sun
  - Boat with ocean environment
  - Car with animations
  - House model
  - Airplane with flight animation
- Integrated voice-over for explanations.
- Background music for immersion.
- Android APK packaged with a UI for navigation.
- Smooth real-time performance on supported devices.

## How It Works
1. The user opens the AR app on an Android device.
2. The camera scans printed image markers.
3. When a marker matches a stored Vuforia target, the application:
   - Loads the corresponding 3D model
   - Plays animations
   - Plays voice narration and background audio
4. The 3D model appears fixed in the real world, allowing the user to walk around and explore it.
5. Multiple models can be viewed by scanning different markers.

## Results
- Fully deployed as an Android AR application (APK).
- High-quality 3D models with smooth animations.
- Accurate marker detection with minimal latency.
- Effective use of AR for interactive learning scenarios.
- Successful integration of audio, animation, and ARCore/Vuforia inside Unity.

Screenshots and demonstration video will be added soon.

## Future Improvements
- Add gesture-based interaction with 3D models.
- Expand the library of educational AR modules.
- Add quizzes and learning activities inside the UI.
- Cloud-based content updates for new AR lessons.
- iOS support using ARKit.
- Improved user interface and navigation design.
